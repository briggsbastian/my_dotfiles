# Briggs Bastian's Dotfiles

* **Fish**

    - Oh My Fish plugin Manager
    - bobthefish theme
    - exa, the ls replacement-
    - ranger, the quick file explorer for terminal

* **tmux**

    - Terminal multipexer, I just really change the color, and add powerline fonts. The default binds are fine for me


* **NEOVIM** 

    - I found AstroNVIM and it changed my life, I no longer configure my own NVIM, I just use this. Game-changer.
