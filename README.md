# Briggs Bastian's Dotfiles

* **Fish**

    - Oh My Fish plugin Manager
    - bobthefish theme
    - exa, the ls replacement-
    - ranger, the quick file explorer for terminal


* **Alacritty**
    - I only really have the font changed to my nerd font of choice, which is Fira Code. You can find Nerd fonts here: https://www.nerdfonts.com/
    - **Linux:** you'll need to download the ` fonts-powerline ` package from your package manager, Make sure to update your package manager before looking elsewhere to install.

    - **Windows:** Just extract the zip and drag them to the fonts tab in Windows settings, or if you're using WSL, it's the same process on Linux

    - **Mac:** good luck, i've never used a mac yet. I imagine brew fonts-powerline.


* **tmux**

    - Terminal multipexer, I just really change the color, and add powerline fonts. The default binds are fine for me


* **NEOVIM**

    - If for some reason you actually want to use mine, please look at just using VSCode with the VIM plugin, it will work way better.
